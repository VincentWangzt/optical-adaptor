"""Tensor-free control-plane contracts for the speculative-training stream.

Per the train-inference disaggregation RFC (issue #3062), every produced sample
is split into a tensor-free reference (this module) and the actual supervision
tensors, which live in a pluggable :mod:`store`. References hop between the
target-side producer and the draft-side consumer over queues, HTTP, and
checkpoint metadata -- places where serializing a :class:`torch.Tensor` would be
either expensive or wrong.

Three guarantees back this module:

1. :func:`assert_no_tensors` enforces "no tensors" recursively on every public
   object exposed from this package, so a producer that slipped a tensor into a
   queue or ref trips a validation error before it lands on a wire.
2. :class:`SampleRef` is a frozen dataclass. Once placed on a queue, a ref
   cannot be mutated under the holder, so the consumer is guaranteed to see the
   same feature keys the producer promised.
3. :class:`FeatureSpec` carries ``dtype`` + ``shape`` (and nothing else), the
   minimum metadata a consumer needs to preallocate the receive buffer *before*
   materializing the tensor -- mirroring how
   :func:`nemo_automodel.components.speculative.eagle.remote.protocol.encode_nccl_metadata`
   already ships dtype + shape ahead of an NCCL recv so the client can allocate.

        run_id: Stable identifier across the whole training run. Same value
            on every ref of one run so producers and consumers can verify
            they are talking about the same run before materializing.
        store_uri: ``scheme://location`` identifying the :class:`FeatureStore`
            back-end (e.g. ``mem://local`` for
            :class:`~nemo_automodel.components.speculative.streaming.stores.local.LocalFeatureStore`).
            The store URI plus ``feature_keys`` form the lookup the consumer
            makes; the store object itself is discovered through the URI at
            materialization time, not stored on the ref.
        feature_keys: Named features this sample contributes, mapped to
            per-store keys (e.g. filenames for ``SharedDirFeatureStore`` in

        feature_specs: Per-feature :class:`FeatureSpec` so the consumer can
            allocate the receive buffer before calling :meth:`FeatureStore.get`.
        algorithm: Which draft family produced this sample; the consumer
            matches it against a registered :class:`FeatureSpec` registry
            to validate the ref before materializing.
        schema_version: Bumped whenever the producer's feature set or tensor
            layout for ``algorithm`` changes incompatibly. The consumer uses
            it as a hard gate on the ref.
        num_tokens: Sum of attended tokens; used by the consumer for empty /
            short loss-mask neutralization and by the queue for backpressure.
        estimated_bytes: Sum of every feature's ``numel() * dtype_bytes``.
            The :class:`SampleRefQueue` reads this against
            :attr:`StoreHealth.resident_bytes` for watermark hysteresis.
        target_model_version: Monotonically increasing identifier of the
            target-model weights that produced this sample. Used to reject
            refs from a stale target (relevant once train-with-decode /
            weight resync lands in PR 4).
        draft_weight_version: Same idea for the draft model's weights, so a
            consumer can refuse to train against a ref produced before its
