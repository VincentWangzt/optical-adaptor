"""File-backed :class:`FeatureStore` for cross-process / cross-node streaming.

:class:`SharedDirFeatureStore` writes one ``<sample_id>.safetensors`` file
per produced sample into a shared directory. Reads return cloned
tensors the consumer can mutate; ``release`` deletes the file once
the last outstanding handle is dropped. Writes are atomic
(tmp file + ``os.replace``) so a concurrent reader never observes a
partial write.

The store is the rendezvous for a multi-process run:

- Each process owns its own :class:`SharedDirFeatureStore` instance
  pointing at the same shared directory. Producers write files; consumers
  in other processes materialize them by ``sample_id`` without needing a
  process-local ownership record.
- The shared directory is the cross-process rendezvous; cross-rank
  routing of which rank reads which ``sample_id`` is left to distributed
  resharding layers above this store.
- Distributed parallelism (FSDP / CP / EP) lives in the trainer's
  forward / backward; this store is rank-local state plus a shared
  filesystem.

Backpressure is identical to :class:`LocalFeatureStore`: sample and
byte caps with the high / low-watermark hysteresis the queue reads.
Residency (:meth:`health` and the ``max_samples`` / ``max_bytes`` caps)
is scoped to the files *this* instance put, tracked in in-memory
counters. That keeps :meth:`health` off the filesystem hot path (the
queue polls it every ``poll_interval`` while a producer is paused) and
gives each rank its full configured budget instead of 1/N of a
directory-global measurement. Files other ranks wrote are not counted
here; disk-global capacity is the deployment's responsibility.
