"""In-process feature store for the speculative-training stream.

The local store keeps tensors in a Python dict under the
:class:`~nemo_automodel.components.speculative.streaming.refs.SampleRef.sample_id`,
with a resident-byte counter so the queue can drive backpressure from the
same store it puts into. It is the build-and-test surface for the entire
streaming pipeline: enough to wire up a colocated producer and consumer
without a network, without a shared mount, and without GPUDirect.

Residency policy (RFC §"Open questions" Q2 answer: bytes as the hard
backstop, sample count as a soft cap). When the next ``put`` would exceed
either cap, :meth:`put` raises :class:`MemoryError` -- the producer is then
expected to retry after the consumer drains below the low watermark.
