"""Pluggable data-plane transport for the speculative-training stream.

The :class:`FeatureStore` ABC abstracts where the supervision tensors actually
live -- an in-process dict for build/test, a POSIX shared mount for
multi-node/colocated, or NCCL for GPU-to-GPU in later PRs. The
:class:`SampleRefQueue` reads the store's :meth:`FeatureStore.health` to
decide whether to back off.

The contract is deliberately small (5 methods + 1 property) so PR 2 and
later have an obvious surface to extend:

- :meth:`put` -- produce-side: stash tensors for a sample.
- :meth:`get`  -- consume-side: materialize them; returns a :class:`StoreHandle`
  the consumer must hand to :meth:`release` once it's done with them.
- :meth:`release` -- consume-once: free / drop the materials.
- :meth:`gc` -- sweep partially-released handles (a stale lease, a crashed
  consumer) so the store cannot leak.
- :meth:`health` -- ints only; the queue uses these for backpressure.
- :meth:`close` -- dispose store resources at shutdown.
