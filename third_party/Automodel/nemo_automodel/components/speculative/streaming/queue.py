"""Lease / ack / fail queue over :class:`SampleRef` for the streaming pipeline.

The :class:`SampleRefQueue` carries only references -- no tensors -- between a
producer (target-side forward) and a consumer (draft-side trainer). Each
"message" is a :class:`SampleRef` and is delivered exactly once: a consumer
leases a ref, materializes its tensors via the
:class:`~nemo_automodel.components.speculative.streaming.store.FeatureStore`,
and then ACKs (release the lease and let the data-plane scrub the sample from
the store) or FAILs (release the lease without scrubbing so a future consumer
may retry).

A lease that is never ACK'd or FAIL'd within :attr:`Lease.visibility_timeout`
is considered orphaned and is reclaimed by
:meth:`SampleRefQueue.reclaim_expired`. That reclaim makes the queue
safe to drive against a producer that may crash mid-flight.

Backpressure is driven by the bound :class:`FeatureStore`'s
:meth:`FeatureStore.health` (ints only -- the queue never touches tensors in
its hot path), with a high/low watermark hysteresis band so a fast producer
cannot OOM the store and a slow producer cannot starve the trainer silently.
The producer-side and consumer-side pause / resume transitions are tracked on
the store via the same :attr:`StoreHealth.high_watermark_hit` /
:attr:`StoreHealth.low_watermark_hit` flags, so a third party (e.g. an ops
dashboard) can observe which side of the pipeline is the bottleneck without
inspecting the queue internals.

    :meth:`fail` verify the lease identity before mutating internal
    state, so a late ACK for a stale (reclaimed) lease cannot pop a
    newer active lease for the same ``sample_id``.

    Attributes:
        ref: The leased reference -- the only sanctioned way to materialize

            considered orphaned. Used by
            :meth:`SampleRefQueue.reclaim_expired` to redeliver the ref.
        visibility_timeout: The :class:`VisibilityTimeout` that produced
            this lease, kept here so the consumer can introspect it.
        redelivery_count: Number of times this ref has been leased and
            re-leased (used for retry telemetry). Starts at 0.
        lease_id: Per-acquire unique identifier. The queue uses it as
            the key in ``_outstanding`` and verifies it before any
            ack/fail mutation.

            before reclaim. Defaults to 30s; production deployments
            normally key this off the recipe's per-step budget.
        high_watermark_bytes: Optional resident-byte threshold for
            pausing. When ``None`` (default), the queue defers to
            :attr:`StoreHealth.high_watermark_hit` (i.e. the store's own

        on_pause / on_resume: Optional callbacks fired when the queue
            transitions high-watermark-paused -> resumed and back.

    Thread safety: a single :class:`threading.Lock` protects every list /
    counter, so a multi-producer / multi-consumer deployment works as long
