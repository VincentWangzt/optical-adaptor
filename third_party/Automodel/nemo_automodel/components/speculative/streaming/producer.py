"""Streaming producer for speculative-decoding draft training.

The :class:`FeatureProducer` wraps a single target-backend forward pass
and ships its output through a :class:`FeatureStore`. The trainer-side
:class:`~nemo_automodel.components.speculative.streaming.loader.FeatureDataLoader`
re-materializes the same data as an
:class:`~nemo_automodel.components.speculative.eagle.target.Eagle3TargetBatch`
and yields it to the trainer loop.

The first producer wraps the existing
:class:`~nemo_automodel.components.speculative.eagle.target.HFEagle3TargetModel`
so the colocated path's numerical output travels bit-for-bit into the
streaming pipeline. Future producers (out-of-process SGLang, NCCL
remote) plug in behind the same ``FeatureProducer`` API without
touching the trainer.
