"""Streaming consumer for speculative-decoding draft training.

:class:`FeatureDataLoader` is a Python iterator over
:class:`Eagle3TargetBatch`. It pulls one :class:`SampleRef` lease at a
time from a :class:`SampleRefQueue`, materializes the tensors through a
:class:`FeatureStore`, hands the trainer a fresh
:class:`Eagle3TargetBatch`, and releases the *previous* lease on every
``__next__`` call -- so the trainer can hold one batch across one full
forward without it being freed mid-forward.

The loader is per-rank and the leases stay on-rank; the queue + store
live in the same Python process as the consumer. FSDP / CP / EP
parallelism lives inside the trainer's forward / backward and is
unaffected by the loader's lifecycle.

    """Iterator over :class:`Eagle3TargetBatch` materialized from a streaming queue.

    Args:
        queue: The metadata-only queue the producer puts :class:`SampleRef`
            onto. ``queue.close()`` at any time cuts the iterator short.
        store: The :class:`FeatureStore` each lease will be materialized
            through. Must match ``ref.store_uri`` for the leased refs.
        algorithm: :class:`FeatureAlgorithm` the loader runs the
            per-algorithm schema check for; defaults to EAGLE-3.

    Lifecycle:
        Each iterator pull yields an :class:`Eagle3TargetBatch` whose
        tensors come from a fresh ``store.get()``. The previous
        batch's lease is ack'd and its store handle released on the
        NEXT pull -- so the trainer can hold one batch across one
        forward pass without it being freed mid-forward. A consumer
        that wants eager reclamation (e.g. to free memory before
        pulling the next batch) calls :meth:`consume_now` after
        computing its loss. Iteration ends on :meth:`close` or when
        the queue drains.
