"""DFlash 2 draft model (Qwen3-style).

DFlash 2 (https://inco.ai/blog/dflash2/) keeps DFlash's one-pass parallel block
draft -- the block is still predicted in a single non-causal forward -- and adds
two cheap modules on top of it:

* A **two-tap dynamic depthwise convolution** before and after each attention and
  MLP sublayer of every draft layer::

      Conv(x)_t = k_{t,0} * x_t + k_{t,1} * x_{t-1}

  Each coefficient is a learned base kernel plus a small correction predicted
  from the current hidden state and shared across ``conv_group_size`` channels.
  The taps never cross a draft-block boundary, so block position 1 reads block
  position 0 -- the last verified (anchor) token -- and block position 0 reads
  zero padding. This moves the short-range within-block work off attention (which
  goes back to reading the target context) and removes most of DFlash's *suffix
  decay*: prediction quality at the end of the block, for ~3% extra parameters.

* A **pairwise path selector**. DFlash picks every position's top-1 candidate
  independently, so neighbours can disagree (a repeated word, a broken phrase)
  and the block is cut short at verification -- even though the right token is
  usually already in the position's candidate list. The selector keeps each
  position's top ``selector_top_k`` candidates and scores every adjacent pair in
  one shot::

      S_t(a, b) = U_t(b) + <A(a) * H(h_t), B(b)>

  ``U_t(b)`` is DFlash's own logit for candidate ``b``; ``A`` and ``B`` are
  rank-``selector_rank`` token codebooks matched under a context gate ``H(h_t)``
  -- a low-rank bilinear score over adjacent candidates. Scoring is fully
  parallel; only the final walk over the precomputed scores is sequential, and it
  touches no backbone or LM head.

Both modules are initialised to the identity (zero conv correction, zero
successor codebook), so a freshly constructed DFlash 2 draft starts out
numerically equal to plain DFlash and training moves it away from there.
