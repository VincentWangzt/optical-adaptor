"""Dispatch registry mapping target architecture -> DFlash draft model.

Mirrors the EAGLE registry (``components/speculative/eagle/registry.py``). The
Qwen3 DFlash draft is a non-causal Qwen3-style stack and is config-driven, so
adding a Qwen3-shaped architecture is a one-line append; a target whose backbone
differs (Kimi K3's MLA) registers its own draft class.

    Attributes:
        draft_cls: The draft model class.
        draft2_cls: The DFlash 2 draft class for this target: the same backbone
            plus the in-block convolutions and the candidate selector. ``None``
            when the family has no DFlash 2 draft, which makes the DFlash 2
            recipe reject the target rather than silently training the plain
            DFlash architecture under a DFlash 2 config.
        build_draft_config: Builds the draft config from the target's text
            config; called with the keyword arguments ``num_draft_layers``,
            ``num_target_layers``, ``block_size``, ``dflash_config``, and
            ``attention_backend``.
        build_target_kwargs: Extra ``from_pretrained`` keyword arguments for the
            frozen target, derived from the recipe's ``recipe_args``.
        attention_backends: The attention backends this draft can run. The
            trainer's mask format is driven by the same knob and must agree (a
            flex ``BlockMask`` only works with the flex attention function, a
            dense additive mask only with sdpa / eager).
        supports_context_parallel: Whether the frozen target can be sharded by
            the DFlash context-parallel path, which installs a key/value-gather
            hook on the target's SDPA call. False for a target that shards the
            sequence itself (it declares ``_owns_cp_attention`` and never routes
            through that hook). This is declared here rather than read off the
            loaded target because the recipe's other CP gates -- which force the
            target onto HuggingFace SDPA -- run before the target exists, and
            would otherwise report a misleading error first.
