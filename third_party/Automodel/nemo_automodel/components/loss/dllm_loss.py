    The forward process mixes an absorbing ``[MASK]`` channel with uniform
    transitions (see :func:`scdd_schedule`), so a position at time ``t`` is
    either ``[MASK]`` or a possibly-wrong non-``[MASK]`` token. The two cases
    contribute different terms to the ELBO:

    * ``z_t = [MASK]`` — the familiar denoising term, the reverse-KL mass that
      the model must place on the clean token when it un-absorbs.
    * ``z_t != [MASK]`` — the **correction** term, the reverse KL of the true
      posterior against the model posterior at an already-visible token. This is
      what trains the model to overwrite its own earlier mistakes, and it is
      scored at every non-``[MASK]`` supervised position, including uncorrupted
      ones (where it vanishes only in the degenerate ``max_ratio = 0`` limit).

    Both terms are scaled by ``num_timesteps`` so the loss is the discrete-time
    NELBO per token rather than a per-step increment.

    Setting ``max_ratio = 0`` removes the uniform channel entirely and the loss
    reduces exactly to the MDLM objective ``-log p(x_0) / t`` at masked
    positions with zero correction term — the invariant the unit tests pin.

    The model output is re-parameterised as a distribution over non-``[MASK]``
    tokens (the ``[MASK]`` logit is driven to ``-inf`` before the log-softmax),
    matching the SCDD backbone parameterisation: the denoiser never predicts the
    absorbing state.

    Unlike the absorbing losses, the ELBO needs the model's probability of
    *every* non-``[MASK]`` token, so it cannot be reduced by a fused
    cross-entropy kernel. The vocabulary-sized work is instead done in position
    chunks wrapped in :func:`torch.utils.checkpoint` (the same treatment
    :meth:`DFlashDecayLoss.forward_fused` gives its LM-head projection), so the
    two ``[positions, vocab]`` fp32 intermediates are recomputed in backward and
    peak activation is one chunk rather than the whole batch.

        w_k = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{k-1}{\\gamma}\\right), \\quad k = 1, \\dots, T

    where *k* indexes the predicted positions within a block (k=0 is the clean
    anchor and is not predicted; k=1 is the first masked position).

    Loss is normalised by the sum of effective weights
    ``(w_k * block_mask)``.  Pass *num_tokens* (a global all-reduced count) for
    normalisation consistent across DP replicas and gradient-accumulation steps.

    Paper default γ values (Appendix A.1):

    - block size 16 → γ = 7
    - block size 10 → γ = 5
    - block size  8 → γ = 4

        use_fused_linear_ce: When True, compute the per-token NLL with the
            chunked linear-CE path (:meth:`forward_fused`) — projects the
            LM head and runs cross-entropy in position chunks, each wrapped in
            :func:`torch.utils.checkpoint` so the full ``[B, T, vocab]`` logits
            tensor is never materialised (peak is one chunk). Keeps large
            ``num_blocks_per_sample`` (e.g. paper-default 512) within memory on
            full-vocab targets.

            We deliberately do NOT use ``liger_kernel``'s
            ``LigerFusedLinearCrossEntropyLoss`` here: its custom autograd
            Function computes ``grad_input`` eagerly in forward and only
            integrates with FSDP via the model-patching redirection
            (``apply_liger_kernel_to_*``). Used standalone under FSDP2 the
            gradient does not reach the sharded model params (grad_norm 0).
            The chunked path is plain autograd, so FSDP2 handles it correctly.
        chunk_size: Number of predicted positions per chunk in the chunked
            linear-CE path. Smaller = lower peak memory, more recompute.
        normalize: Loss denominator. ``"tokens"`` (default) divides the
            decay-weighted sum by ``num_tokens``, a global all-reduced count
            that keeps the loss consistent across DP replicas and grad-accum.
            ``"mean"`` divides by the effective weight sum
            ``(w_k * block_mask).sum()`` for a per-call decay-weighted mean.

    """Introspective DLM all-masked loss (Yu et al., 2026; arXiv:2604.11035).

    Operates on the concatenated ``[x_t (L) | x_0 (L)]`` forward output produced
    under the block-diffusion attention mask, where ``x_t`` is the noisy (masked)
    copy and ``x_0`` the clean copy. With a next-token "logit shift" (the hidden
    state at position ``i`` predicts token ``i+1``) the objective combines two
    cross-entropy terms, both supervised on the response (answer) tokens:

    .. math::
        L = \\text{CE}_\\text{noisy} + \\alpha \\cdot \\text{CE}_\\text{clean}

    - ``CE_noisy`` — decode CE on the ``x_t`` half (distribution ``q``): each
      masked token is conditioned on the clean ground-truth prefix.
    - ``CE_clean`` — verify CE on the ``x_0`` half (distribution ``p``): the
      clean copy of the response under strict causal attention.

    With ``auto_balance=True`` the fixed weight is replaced by the detached
    ratio ``CE_noisy / CE_clean`` each step so the two terms stay comparable in
    magnitude (paper Eq. 2, used for the later stride expansions). Otherwise the
    fixed ``clean_loss_weight`` is used (the paper's ``0.2`` for early training).

    Args:
