"""Two-rank CPU regression tests for Kimi Linear context parallelism.

The rest of ``test_cp.py`` drives a fake mesh with no process group, so the one
collective Kimi Linear owns end to end -- the ``_AllGatherSequence`` autograd
Function that MLA uses to gather the compressed KV latent -- is never actually
executed. These tests run it on two gloo ranks, where a wrong backward (missing
all-reduce, or narrowing to the wrong shard) shows up immediately.
