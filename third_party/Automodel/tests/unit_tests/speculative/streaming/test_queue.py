"""Unit tests for :class:`SampleRefQueue`.

The queue is the only control-plane coupler between producers and consumers;
its guarantees are:

1. FIFO lease ordering across multiple producers / consumers within a
   single process.
2. :class:`VisibilityTimeout` reclaim: a lease whose deadline has passed
   is re-deliverable, with the redelivery count incremented.
3. Backpressure via :meth:`FeatureStore.health` (ints only).
4. :meth:`fail` re-enqueues a lease for retry without dropping its
   tensors; :meth:`ack` is the only sanctioned way to free the lease.
5. :meth:`close` drains the queue (subsequent acquires return ``None``).

These tests run CPU-only and exercise the API directly rather than through
the trainer. PR 2's :class:`FeatureDataLoader` consumer integration is the
end-to-end coverage for the recipe-side path.
