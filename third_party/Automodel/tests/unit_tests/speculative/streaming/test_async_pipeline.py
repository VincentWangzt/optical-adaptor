"""Unit tests for :class:`AsyncFeaturePipeline`.

The pipeline's contract under test:

1. The background thread drains a prompt source, runs the wrapped
   :class:`FeatureProducer`, and pushes each :class:`SampleRef` onto
   the queue via ``put_blocks_until_below`` so the queue's HWM/LWM
   hysteresis governs the producer's pacing.
2. ``start`` / ``stop`` / context-manager lifecycle is idempotent.
3. Prompt-source exhaustion stops the thread (when
   ``stop_on_exhausted=True``); a streaming source is polled until
   shutdown.
4. An exception in the prompt source (or the producer) is captured
   and re-raised on ``stop``, so the trainer sees it.
5. A concurrent loader can iterate the queue while the pipeline runs,
   overlapping target forward with draft-side consumption.
