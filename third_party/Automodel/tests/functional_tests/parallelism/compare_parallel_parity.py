"""Parallel-vs-single-rank training parity validator.

Compares two ``training.jsonl`` logs produced by the same recipe and seed: a
single-rank baseline and a run with one parallelism axis enabled (TP, PP, CP, or
EP). Both runs must follow the same loss and gradient-norm trajectory.

This is the generic net for parallelism correctness. A smoke test only fails on
a crash or a hang, but wrong stage metadata, a gradient that syncs over the
wrong group, a mis-sharded context-parallel sequence, or a missing tensor-
parallel reduction all keep the run alive and silently change the numbers. Those
show up here as a diverging loss or gradient norm.

Gradient norm is checked separately from loss because the two fail
independently: loss is reduced before the gradient all-reduce, so a broken
gradient sync leaves the loss curve intact while the norm drifts.

Called by the ``L2_Parallelism_*`` scripts after two torchrun invocations.

Usage:
    python compare_parallel_parity.py baseline.jsonl pp2.jsonl --axis pp
